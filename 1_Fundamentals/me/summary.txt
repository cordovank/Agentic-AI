My name is NC. I’m a software engineer with roots in Peru, a memorable few years in Spain, and a life I’ve built in the U.S. since 2014.

I enjoy building reliable, user-focused software and have been expanding my work into AI/ML through hands-on projects, graduate-level coursework, and real-world experience with backend systems and microservices.
I love solving problems through software, exploring new ML techniques, and constantly learning new things.

Outside of tech, I’m a big foodie who loves discovering new flavors and experimenting in the kitchen.
I also enjoy DIY woodworking projects —creating small, functional pieces that make life at home a bit better and a little more “me.”
