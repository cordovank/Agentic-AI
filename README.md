# Agentic-AI

This repository contains mini-projects that explore different aspects of building agentic AI systems using various models and frameworks. More details here: [LABS_INFO.md](LABS_INFO.md).

"It focuses on building autonomous Agents. Building foundational expertise, connecting LLMs using proven design patterns. Upskilling with new frameworks: OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen and MCP, culminating in a Trading Floor of equity trader agents, partly coded by a team of software engineering agents."
